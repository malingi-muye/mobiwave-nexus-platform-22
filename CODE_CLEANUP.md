# Code Cleanup Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to clean up redundant and unused hooks in the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. SMS Service Hooks Consolidation

The following hooks have been consolidated:
- `useRealSMSService.ts` - Marked as deprecated
- `useSMSService.ts` - Marked as deprecated
- `useUnifiedSMSService.ts` - Enhanced with all functionality from the deprecated hooks

All functionality from the deprecated hooks has been moved to `useUnifiedSMSService`, which now provides:
- Basic SMS sending
- Campaign-based SMS sending
- Scheduled and automated SMS campaigns
- Balance checking
- Delivery report retrieval

### 2. SMS Templates Hooks Consolidation

- `src/hooks/useSMSTemplates.ts` - Marked as deprecated
- `src/hooks/sms/useSMSTemplates.ts` - Maintained as the primary implementation

The hook in the root hooks directory has been marked as deprecated, and developers should use the one in the `sms` subdirectory.

### 3. Error Handling Hooks Consolidation

- `useErrorHandler.ts` - Marked as deprecated
- `useEnhancedErrorHandler.ts` - Enhanced with all functionality from the basic error handler

The enhanced error handler now includes all the functionality from the basic error handler, making it the single source for error handling in the application.

### 4. API Credential Hooks Consolidation

- `useApiKeys.ts` - Marked as deprecated
- `useSecureApiCredentials.ts` - Enhanced with functionality from `useApiKeys`
- `useAllApiCredentials.ts` - Maintained for admin functionality

The secure API credentials hook now includes all the functionality from the API keys hook, providing a unified interface for API credential management.

## Migration Guide for Developers

### Updating Imports

If your component imports any of the deprecated hooks, update your imports as follows:

```typescript
// Before
import { useSMSService } from '@/hooks/useSMSService';
import { useRealSMSService } from '@/hooks/useRealSMSService';

// After
import { useUnifiedSMSService } from '@/hooks/useUnifiedSMSService';
```

```typescript
// Before
import { useSMSTemplates } from '@/hooks/useSMSTemplates';

// After
import { useSMSTemplates } from '@/hooks/sms/useSMSTemplates';
```

```typescript
// Before
import { useErrorHandler } from '@/hooks/useErrorHandler';

// After
import { useEnhancedErrorHandler } from '@/hooks/useEnhancedErrorHandler';
```

```typescript
// Before
import { useApiKeys } from '@/hooks/useApiKeys';

// After
import { useSecureApiCredentials } from '@/hooks/useSecureApiCredentials';
```

### Updating Function Calls

#### SMS Service

```typescript
// Before
const { sendSMS } = useSMSService();
await sendSMS({ recipients, message });

// After
const { sendSMS } = useUnifiedSMSService();
await sendSMS({ recipients, message });
```

For more advanced SMS functionality:

```typescript
const { sendUnifiedSMS } = useUnifiedSMSService();
await sendUnifiedSMS({
  recipients,
  message,
  campaignName: 'My Campaign',
  scheduleConfig: { type: 'immediate' }
});
```

#### Error Handling

```typescript
// Before
const { handleError } = useErrorHandler();
handleError(error, { operation: 'fetch data' });

// After
const { handleError } = useEnhancedErrorHandler();
handleError(error, { operation: 'fetch data', component: 'UserProfile' });
```

#### API Credentials

```typescript
// Before
const { createApiKey } = useApiKeys();
await createApiKey({ key_name: 'Test Key', permissions: ['read'] });

// After
const { generateApiKey } = useSecureApiCredentials();
await generateApiKey({ keyName: 'Test Key', permissions: ['read'] });
```

## Next Steps

1. After all components have been updated to use the consolidated hooks, the deprecated hooks can be completely removed from the codebase.
2. Run comprehensive tests to ensure all functionality works correctly after the migration.
3. Consider further organizing hooks into domain-specific directories for better maintainability.
